    <h2 id="html-index" class="font-family-title font-size-subtitle center">Fundamentals of HTML</h2>
    <p class="font-family-text font-size-regular">HTML, which stands for HyperText Markup Language, is the standard
      language used to create web pages. It was
      created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991 as a way to share scientific documents online at CERN (European Organization
      for Nuclear Research). Since then, it has evolved to become the foundational pillar of the modern web.</p>

    <p class="font-family-text font-size-regular">The basic structure of an HTML page consists of elements or tags that
      enclose content and give it meaning. These
      elements are formed by an opening tag, the content, and a closing tag.</p>

    <h2 id="css-index" class="font-family-title font-size-subtitle center">Fundamentals of CSS</h2>
    <p class="font-family-text font-size-regular">Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to describe
      the presentation of a document written in
      HTML or XML. CSS describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2 class="font-family-title font-size-subtitle center">CSS Selectors</h2>
    <p class="font-family-text font-size-regular">In CSS, selectors are used to target the HTML elements on our web
      pages that we want to style. There are a wide variety of CSS selectors available, allowing for fine-grained
      precision when selecting elements to style.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2 class="font-family-title font-size-subtitle center">The Box Model</h2>
    <p class="font-family-text font-size-regular">Everything in CSS has a box around it, and understanding these boxes
      is key to being able to create more complex layouts with CSS, or to align items with other items.</p>
    <p class="font-family-text font-size-regular">In CSS we have several types of boxes that generally fit into the
      categories of block boxes and inline boxes. The type refers to how the box behaves in terms of page flow and in
      relation to other boxes on the page. Boxes have an inner display type and an outer display type.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2 class="font-family-title font-size-subtitle center">Organizing your CSS</h2>
    <p class="font-family-text font-size-regular">As you start to work on larger stylesheets and big projects you will
      discover that maintaining a huge CSS file can be challenging.</p>
    <p class="font-family-text font-size-regular">If you are working with a team on an existing project, the first thing
      to check is whether the project has an existing style guide for CSS. The team style guide should always win over
      your own personal preferences. There often isn't a right or wrong way to do things, but consistency is important.
    </p>
    <p class="font-family-text font-size-regular">Adding comments to your CSS will help any future developer work with
      your CSS file, but will also help you when you come back to the project after a break.</p>

    <h2 id="js-index" class="font-family-title font-size-subtitle center">Fundamentals of JavaScript</h2>
    <p class="font-family-text font-size-regular">JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight interpreted (or just-in-time
      compiled) programming language with first-class functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language
      for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat.
      JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented,
      imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles.</p>
    <p class="font-family-text font-size-regular">JavaScript's dynamic capabilities include runtime object construction,
      variable parameter lists, function variables, dynamic script creation, object introspection, and source-code
      recovery.</p>
